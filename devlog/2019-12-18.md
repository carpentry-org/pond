Timebox: 1 hour

## Goals

Today I want to create a text editor view that can send the current file to a
Carp checker and get the results back; maybe even highlight the errors already,
if I can figure out how to.

## Potential Roadblocks

I’m still pretty sick and a little disoriented, and I probably shouldn’t work
at all, but I really want to.

## Review

Time worked: 1:00

I was able to make it kinda sorta work. I can open an unhighlighted Carp
editor, play around in it, and try to check the results using a button that
spits out the error in a new inspector for me. This isn’t quite what I
envisioned, but all the pieces are there. I just need to connect the dots
somehow now.
