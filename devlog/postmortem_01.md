# Postmortem: Building an IDE for Carp in Pharo in December 2019

In the last week of 2019, I wanted to start building an IDE for Carp in Pharo
Smalltalk. I was unable to make much headway during that time, and I was able
to identify two factors that held me back:

- Firstly, I was fairly inexperienced with the tools Pharo provides for working
  with programming languages. While I am somewhat aware of SmaCC, FAMIX, and
  Moose, I was not sure how they fit together, and I decided to focus on
  creating a connection to the compiler and parsing it’s results myself first.
  This proved to be annoyingly hard to do, which demotivated me.
- I got sick. I was unable to work more than one or two hours a day due to a
  cold, which of course slowed me down tremendously also, and obliterated
  basically all of the motivation I still had left.

In the end, I didn‘t get very far, but that‘s okay. I‘m not in a rush to get my
ideas out and mostly investigate to satisfy my own self intellectual curiosity,
misguided as it might or might not be.
