Timebox: 3 Hours

## Goals

I want to be able to check Carp source by writing a file to the
file system, checking it, and parsing the results into a good
data structure. Copied from yesterday.

## Potential Roadblocks

I’m still feeling a little sick and concentrating could be a little
hard.

## Review

Time worked: 1h30m

Well, this was another frustrating day with Pharo. Apparently, the
OS process abstraction I’m using has a bug on my OS X where it never
terminates the process. Once again, [I’ve opened an issue](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/OSSubprocess/issues/52).
The issue description is shorter than I’d usually like, but I don’t
quite know what’s going on, so I’ll just leave it at that.

Despite this frustration I was able to make it work by adding a tiny
manual delay—yuck—and then just checking the output of the command.
It’s parsing the response into a data structure that I’ll be able to
use in the IDE environment.

My head starts to hurt a little bit so I decided to leave it at that
for today.
