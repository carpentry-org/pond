Timebox: 2 Hours

## Goals

I want to have a good abstraction for Carp inside the `OSProcess`
working. I want to be able to push input into the process and read
it out again, know the status of the process, etc.

## Potential Roadblocks

Because documentation on `OSProcess` is basically non-existant,
I’ll likely spend a lot of time hunting down the right API; I just
hope that it even exists.

## Review

Time worked: 1h30m

I got the basics of reading from Carp and writing to Carp working.
`OSProcess` turned out not to be what I need, instead I’m now using
a library called `OSSubProcess` that has a way more powerful API and
better documentation.

Sadly `OSSubProcess` requires me to close the `stdin` stream after the
first chunk of writing to it. I’m not sure whether I can reopen the
stream, it seems not to work. I filed [an issue on Github](https://github.com/pharo-contributions/OSSubprocess/issues/51),
but I suspect that this is actually not really fixable/not a use
case that they want to support. We will see. I gave up getting more
done for today.
