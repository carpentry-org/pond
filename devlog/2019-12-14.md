Timebox: 2 Hours

## Goals

I want to have a good abstraction for Carp inside the `OSProcess`
working. I want to be able to push input into the process and read
it out again, know the status of the process, etc.

## Potential Roadblocks

Because documentation on `OSProcess` is basically non-existant,
Iâ€™ll likely spend a lot of time hunting down the right API; I just
hope that it even exists.

## Review
